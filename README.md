# **TFTWeather**

## Overview :sunny:

The world as we know is not anymore the way it used to be. TFTWeather is a technologically advanced, complicated project that might in the future change the way we think.
It provides you with temperature, humidity, and pressure updates on a futuristic LCD touchscreen.

**_TFTWeather - feel the future. Be the future._**

## Description :snowflake:

TFTWeather is an university project made by Artur Bronka and Lukasz Dobek - student's at Electric Department of Poznan University of Technology. It was being developed since March 2018 till June 2018. There are two main assumptions of said project: first being making use of LCD TFT 3,2 inch display, second being gathering data from devices such as DHT11 to provide user with humidity and temperature updates and displaying them both on screen.

## Tools :cyclone:

To make it all happen, we've used STM32F4 Discovery board, 3,2 inch TFT display, DHT11 and C programming skills. We've been writing our code in System Workbench which let's us compile the code easily, and send it to the microcontroller even easier.

## How to run :cloud:

Simply fetch our project, and run it on your own! We recommend using System Workbench tool, as it's easier to use the same workspace as we did. Connect both TFT display and DHT11 display as we did (you can find instructions on how to do that in DHT11 and LCD header files), connect your STM32F4 Discovery to the computer, and run it! If you've connected everything properly there shouldn't be any problem (even if there is - don't be ashamed, let us know as we will probably be able to help you).

## How to compile :zap:

Let your compiler do the work, there is nothing more to it.

## Future improvements :partly_sunny:

We've specified a list, that we'll be trying to fullfill. Even though the project is complete, there is still more to do with our equipment.
TODO:
- touch panel control,
- gathering pressure data from BMP280.
